Hereâ€™s a summary of what was accomplished in your OpenTSSL project during this session:

Summary of Work Completed
1. Key Generation and Management
RSA, DSA, and EC Key Support
The Tcl commands opentssl::key::generate, opentssl::key::parse, and opentssl::key::write now support RSA, DSA, and EC (Elliptic Curve) keys.
EC key generation allows specifying the curve (default: prime256v1).
All key types can be parsed and written in PEM format.
Codebase Fixes
Fixed logic in KeyGenerateCmd to properly branch for RSA, DSA, and EC keys.
Ensured all code paths return a value, resolving build warnings.
Corrected unreachable code for DSA key generation.
Build
The project now builds successfully. There are warnings about deprecated OpenSSL functions, but these do not prevent compilation.
2. Tcl Integration
The shared library (libopentssl.so) loads in Tcl as expected.
All key management commands (opentssl::key::generate, opentssl::key::parse, opentssl::key::write) are available and working.
3. Documentation and TODOs
The TODO.md and README.md were updated to reflect:
RSA, DSA, and EC key management in PEM format is complete.
DER format support for all key types is the next milestone.
Additional features (HMAC, Base64/Hex encoding/decoding, more X.509 fields) are listed as future steps.
Next Steps
Implement DER format support for RSA, DSA, and EC keys.
Address OpenSSL deprecation warnings in the C code.
Extend key parsing/writing to handle more metadata and key types.
Implement HMAC and encoding/decoding commands as outlined in the TODO.
